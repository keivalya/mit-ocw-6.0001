# 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python

## Fall 2016 / Undergraduate
I am taking [this]() MIT OpenCourseWare MOOC to strengthen my python programming foundations, especially because lately I have been (a little bit) uncomfortable with recursion. Also, I thought it would be a good idea to take this course as a prerequisite for [mit-ocw-6.006 - Algorithms](https://github.com/keivalya/mit-ocw-6006)!

## Textbooks
Throughout this course I have referred to the [
Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, second edition](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262529624/introduction-to-computation-and-programming-using-python/) Textbook by MIT Press, 2016. ISBN: 9780262529624.
